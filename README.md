# Professional ReadMe Writer

My application utilizes Node and Inquirer npm in order to receive input data from a user and create a readme that follows their guidelines.

I was able to learn a lot about how to utilize functions to carry over information into other parts of code as well as using the `` to generate readMe file creations. I was also able to learn more about using the fs write file to create files for me as well.
